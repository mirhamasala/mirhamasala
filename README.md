# Hi! I'm Mirha. ðŸŽˆ

I'm a frontend developer who likes to dabble in the deep, dark back. I'm oddly interested in best coding practices and refactoring.

In my free time, I work on [Neo's Tree](https://www.neostree.com). And I also [write](https://www.mirhamasala.com).

ðŸ¥ž Stack: Vue.js, Rails & Tailwind

ðŸ‘¯ Collabs: Iâ€™m always up for a pair programming session, so [reach out](https://www.mirhamasala.com/contact) if that sounds fun.

âš¡ Fun fact: I spent five years [trying out 12 different lifestyles](https://www.thespinoffproject.com).
