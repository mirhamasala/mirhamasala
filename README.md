# Hi! I'm Mirha. ☀️

I'm a frontend developer who likes to dabble in the deep, dark back. I'm oddly interested in best coding practices and refactoring.

In my free time, I work on side projects, like [Neo's Tree](https://www.neostree.com), [Slow Retreats](http://slow-retreats.vercel.app/), and [Jungle](https://next-jungle.vercel.app/). And I also [write](https://www.mirhamasala.com).

🥞 Current fave stack: React, Next.js + Tailwind

👯 Collabs: I'm always up for a pairing session, so [reach out](https://www.mirhamasala.com/contact) if that sounds fun.

⚡ Fun fact: I spent five years [trying out 12 different lifestyles](https://www.thespinoffproject.com).
